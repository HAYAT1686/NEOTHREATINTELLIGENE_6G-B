Dataset related to network traffic analysis. Each row seems to represent a network connection, characterized by various attributes. This type of dataset is often used in network intrusion detection research. Here's a breakdown of what each column likely represents based on common network traffic datasets, such as the KDD Cup 1999 dataset or similar intrusion detection datasets:

Duration: Length (in seconds) of the connection.
Protocol type: Type of protocol (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp).
Service: Network service on the destination (e.g., http, ftp, smtp).
Flag: Normal or error status of the connection.
Source bytes: Number of data bytes from source to destination.
Destination bytes: Number of data bytes from destination to source.
Land: 1 if connection is from/to the same host/port; 0 otherwise.
Wrong fragment: Number of wrong fragments.
Urgent: Number of urgent packets.
Hot: Number of “hot” indicators.
Failed logins: Number of failed login attempts.
Logged in: 1 if successfully logged in; 0 otherwise.
Number of compromised conditions: Number of compromised conditions.
Root shell: 1 if root shell is obtained; 0 otherwise.
Su attempts: Number of “su root” command attempts.
Number of root accesses: Number of root accesses.
Number of file creations: Number of file creation operations.
Number of shells: Number of shell prompts.
Number of access files: Number of operations on access control files.
Number of outbound commands: Number of outbound commands in an ftp session.
Is hot login: 1 if the login belongs to the “hot” list; 0 otherwise.
Is guest login: 1 if the login is a guest login; 0 otherwise.
Count: Number of connections to the same host as the current connection in the past two seconds.
Srv count: Number of connections to the same service as the current connection in the past two seconds.
Serror rate: % of connections that have “SYN” errors.
Srv serror rate: % of connections that have “SYN” errors for the same service.
Rerror rate: % of connections that have “REJ” errors.
Srv rerror rate: % of connections that have “REJ” errors for the same service.
Same srv rate: % of connections to the same service.
Diff srv rate: % of connections to different services.
Srv diff host rate: % of connections to different hosts.
Dst host count: Number of connections to the same destination host.
Dst host srv count: Number of connections to the same service as the current connection to the destination host.
Dst host same srv rate: % of connections to the same service at the destination host.
Dst host diff srv rate: % of connections to different services at the destination host.
Dst host same src port rate: % of connections to the same source port.
Dst host srv diff host rate: % of connections to different hosts for the same service.
Dst host serror rate: % of connections that have “SYN” errors at the destination host.
Dst host srv serror rate: % of connections that have “SYN” errors for the same service at the destination host.
Dst host rerror rate: % of connections that have “REJ” errors at the destination host.
Dst host srv rerror rate: % of connections that have “REJ” errors for the same service at the destination host.
Label: Indicates whether the connection is normal or a specific type of attack (e.g., normal, neptune, warezclient, ipsweep, etc.).
Difficulty level: The difficulty level associated with the record (if applicable).
